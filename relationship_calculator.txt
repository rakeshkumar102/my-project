function for removing common characters
with their respective occurrences

if common character is found
then remove that character
and return list of concatenated
list with True Flag
remove character from the list

concatenation of two list elements with *
* is act as border mark here

return the concatenated list with True flag

no common characters is found
return the concatenated list with False flag

take first name
converted all letters into lower case
replace any space with empty string

make a list of letters or characters
take 2nd name

taking a flag as True initially

keep calling remove_match_char function
until common characters is found or
keep looping until proceed flag is True


function calling and store return value
take out concatenated list from return list

take out flag value from return list
find the index of "*" / border mark
list slicing perform
all characters before * store in p1_list
all characters after * store in p2_list
count total remaining characters

list of FLAMES acronym
keep looping until only one item
is not remaining in the result list

store that index value from
where we have to perform slicing.

this steps is done for performing
anticlock-wise circular fashion counting.

list slicing
list concatenation
print final result

______________________________

The code starts by taking the first name, player 1 name.

It converts all of the letters into lower case and replaces any space with an empty string.

Next, it makes a list of all of the letters in player 1’s name.

The code then takes the second name, player 2 name.

It converts all of the letters into lower case and replaces any space with an empty string.

Next, it creates a list of characters from both players’ names.

The code starts by setting the proceed flag to True .

Then it calls the remove_match_char function on each list.

The remove_match_char function looks for common characters between both lists and removes them.

If no common characters are found, then proceed is set to False and the loop ends.

However, if common characters are found, then ret_list[0] stores the index of “*” in it (the border mark),
 ret_list[1] stores the flag value (True ), 

and star_index stores the index of where that character was found in p1_list or p2_list (depending on which list was used).
So after removing all of the common characters from each list, p1_list and p2_list

The code firstly takes in two player names as input.

Next, all of the letters in each name are converted to lower case.

Finally, any spaces are replaced with an empty string.

A list of these strings is then created.

Next, the remove_match_char function is called once for each list.

This function looks for a common character between the two lists and removes it.

If no common characters are found, the return value is [list1, False] and the proceed flag is set to True .

If a common character is found, the return value is [list3, True] and the proceed flag is set to False .

Finally, the concatenated list is returned with either [list3, True].
